My Wolfram Alpha is a one-man endeavor to fully recreate Wolfram Alpha from scratch in C, just for the hell of it.
This software aims to implement all of Wolfram Alpha's services bit by bit, as well as provding a redesigned GUI 
and navigation. Any advice and suggestions to the project would be greatly appreciated! For further contact, check
my email in my profile!
