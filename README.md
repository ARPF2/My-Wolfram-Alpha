My Wolfram Alpha is a one-man endeavor to recreate the one and only computational intelligence from scratch
in C using the Windows API, just for the hell of it. From its mathematical and scientific problem-solving 
prowess, to its vast knowledgebase of people and history, this software aims to replicate, albeit imperfectly
of course, all of its features and services, with a redesigned user interface and navigation.

Any advice or suggestions to the project would be greatly appreciated! For further contact, use my email in
my bio.
